<h2>About Us</h2>
<h5> What We Do </h5>
<p>The Indie Quest is a course in programming, art, and production, specifically designed for creating indie games. Instead of studying individual subjects in isolation, you acquire the skills directly by using them on game projects.  You will first become an apprentice, completing carefully designed game coding missions that will build your programming knowledge step-by-step. You will then extend these foundations by learning advanced concepts while creating your own games. Applying project management strategies will help you prototype your ideas and polish the end result to share your games with the world. On the art side of things you will choose any visual style that you want for your games. A study plan personalized for your goals will guide you through the art fundamentals and technical aspects required to bring your vision to life. Be it pixel art, 3D, traditional drawing, or digital painting, we have you covered. Learn more about the <a href="curriculm.html">curriculum.</a></p>
